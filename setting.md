## People

"Loag Krad" is the name given to the enormous labyrinth of caves beneath
the land of Llaigis. (PCs do _not_ know that Loag Krad is in Llaigis.)
The moniker is fairly common among anyone who speaks Llaigisan within,
but some feel no need to label the place. There is no continuity of
community all through Loag Krad, but many medium-sized groups whose
claims are loosely staked in various parts. Settlers, roving nomads, and
hardy individuals can all be found here.

Several qualities are especially common among the people of Loag Krad:

*   _Forgetfulness_. Those who were not born here often cannot remember
    why they came. Basic details of their past lives elude them. Despite
    this amnesia, most people you encounter eke out a modest living.
    Perhaps the unsuitable ones were screened out by natural selection.
*   _Agreeableness_. There are well-known bandit groups in Loag Krad,
    but they are the exception rather than the rule. Most people
    recognize the importance of banding together and are happy to do so,
    reaping the benefits of cooperation. This quality cannot paper over
    all disagreements, though, and inter-community feuds are not unheard
    of.
*   _Passivity_. Loag Krad is not a nice place to be. Nobody here leads
    an enviable life. Yet most residents have never contemplated
    leaving; they find the idea difficult to reason about, and are
    typically not interested in the idea. PCs should find it difficult
    to recruit NPCs into their party.

Finally, most NPCs are fearful of _The Warden_: a hazily defined
authority figure said to dwell at the bottommost level of Loag Krad,
ruling passively over the everlasting night. The Warden asks no tribute
and makes no demands, but appears to exercise some magical influence
over the whole. Those who seriously wish to leave Loag Krad - like this
fine party of PCs - might consider venturing to the darkest depths to
make entreaty of this person?

## Loag Krad

### Key Item: Scroll of Safe Passage

The Scroll of Safe Passage is a relic of unknown origin. It grants the
bearer (plus several guests of their choosing) protection from the worst
effects of Loag Krad.

In particular, the scroll has the following properties:

*   _Guidance_. The bearer cannot fast-travel freely between levels, but
    can (with the influence of the scroll) reliably find the ingress and
    egress points of each level.
*   _Protection_. The bearer is not immune to attacks or aggression, but
    most things dwelling within Loag Krad are more likely to overlook
    the bearer.
*   _Exit Guarantee_. The bearer can safely leave Loag Krad without ill
    effect.

### Key Item: Warden's Scroll

The Warden's Scroll is a relic of unknown origin. It is a more powerful
version of the Scroll of Safe Passage, granting the bearer (plus several
guests of their choosing) protection from most effects of Loag Krad.

In particular, the scroll has the following properties:

*   _Guidance_. The scroll provides four charges with which the bearer
    can teleport to any point inside Loag Krad. Every day, the scroll
    regains `1d4` charges.
*   _Dominion_. The bearer is not immune to attacks or aggression, but
    gains a massive edge in intimidation and charisma, staying the hand
    of all but the bravest hearts.
*   _Exit Guarantee_. The bearer can safely leave Loag Krad without ill
    effect.
