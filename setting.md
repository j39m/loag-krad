# Setting

This document describes _massive_ spoilers and must not be casually
revealed to PCs.

Loag Krad is the name given to the enormous labyrinth of caves beneath
the land of Llaigis. The moniker is fairly common among anyone who
speaks Llaigisan within, but some feel no need to label the place.
There is no continuity of community all through Loag Krad, but many
medium-sized groups whose claims are loosely staked in various parts.
Settlers, roving nomads, and hardy individuals can all be found here.
